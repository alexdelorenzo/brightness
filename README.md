# â˜€ brightness: Adjust display brightness with your ðŸŒž

`brightness` is a daemon and command-line utility you can use to adjust your display's brightness.

In daemonized mode, `brightness` will use facial recognition to determine whether or not to change your display's brightness when your system is idle.

As a command-line utility, you can use `brightness` to get and set your display's brightness.

# Usage

  $ brightness

  75.0

Options:
  -c, --capture INTEGER           Capture device.  [default: 0]
  -b, --brightness INTEGER RANGE  Screen brightness between 0 and 100.
                                  [default: 0]
  -d, --daemon                    Use this setting to simply change the
                                  display brightness, while ignoring other
                                  settings besides brightness and device.
                                  [default: False]
  -i, --idle FLOAT                Seconds between inactivtiy and facial

  -f, --frames INTEGER            Number of frames to capture in succession.
                                  Increase this value if you're getting false

  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Example
Check for system idle time every 120 seconds, then if idle, capture 2 frames from device `0` for use in facial recognition.

`python3 change_brightness.py -d 0 --brightness 0 --idle 120 -f 2`
