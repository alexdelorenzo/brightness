# â˜€ brightness: Adjust display brightness with your ðŸŒž

`brightness` is a daemon and command-line utility that adjusts your display's brightness.

In daemonized mode, `brightness` will use facial recognition to determine whether or not to change your display's brightness when your system goes idle.

As a command-line utility, you can use `brightness` to get and set your display's brightness.

# Usage

```bash
Usage: brightness [OPTIONS]

  Use system idle information and facial recognition to change screen
  brightness when your computer idle and there isn't anyone in front of the
  screen.

  Run without arguments to get the current brightness for the default
  display.

  $ brightness
  75.0

Options:
  -c, --capture INTEGER           Capture device.  [default: 0]
  -b, --brightness INTEGER RANGE  Screen brightness between 0 and 100.
                                  [default: 0]
  -d, --daemon                    Use this setting to simply change the
                                  display brightness, while ignoring other
                                  settings besides brightness and device.
                                  [default: False]
  -i, --idle FLOAT                Seconds between inactivtiy and facial
                                  recognition.  [default: 300]
  -f, --frames INTEGER            Number of frames to capture in succession.
                                  Increase this value if you're getting false
                                  negatives  [default: 2]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Example

Change the brightness to 50%

`brightness -b 50`

Run in daemonized mode. Check every 10 minutes for a face.

`brightness -d -i 600`

Check for system idle time every 120 seconds, then if idle, capture 2 frames from device `0` for use in facial recognition.

`brightness -d -c 0 -b 0 -i 120 -f 2`
